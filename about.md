Hi! My name is Ivan and I am software engineer. I am fond of distributed
systems and everything all around complex software. Most of the time I am
creating something or reading papers on distsys, reliability, resilience,
scalability etc. I work with Linux and Open Source. I am interested in
details of storage engines and databases research.

Most of what I read I post on twitter.

In spare time I have a lot of hobbies from sports to music and cooking.
Yet I am conservative and struggle for perfection.
