### Ivan Prisyazhnyy.

I am backend systems software engineer and a fan of Linux, Open Source,
Distributed Systems, Programming Paradigms, and Storage engines.

In a free time I reverse engineer something, read whitepapers or play guitar.
I like what Twitter, Facebook, Google and Amazon OSS guys do.

In all the rest I am trying to fit my perfectionism into reasonable constraints.
