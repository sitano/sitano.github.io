Hi! My name is Ivan and I am software engineer. I love distributed
systems and databases. Most of the time I write code or
read whitepapers. I work with Linux and Open Source.

Most of what I have read I post on twitter.

In a spare time I do a lot of hobbies From sports to music and cooking.
Yet I am conservative and struggle for perfection.
