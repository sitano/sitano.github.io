### Ivan Prisyazhnyy.

Linux open source backend engineer, passionate about Distributed Systems,
Open Source, Programming Paradigms, and Storage engines.

My hobby is reverse engineering and learning. I am fan of Twitter, Facebook,
Google and Amazon OSS, Unix, Colemak, Vim/Emacs and mechanical keyboards.

I am fond of fitness and boxing, the same much I am trying to fit my
perfectionism into reasonable constraints.
