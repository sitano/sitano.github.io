## SUMMARY

_Software Engineer (SWE)._

I build systems that run on Linux in the Cloud with Open Source.
My focus is on Distributed Systems, System Programming, and Databases.
With Rust, C/C++, Go, Java, and whatever it takes.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Software Engineer in Rust Team at Workato

_September 2023 - Present_

Workato makes one of the best no-code automation platforms.

Projects: internal database (Rust & MariaDB & AWS).
          it is an internal product like Airtable or NocoDB.

Areas:

- BYOK (bring-your-own-key) data encryption at rest.
- In-house database scalability.
- Online cluster topology.
- On-premise data cluster & controller.

I have developed BYOK solution for data-at-rest encryption for in-house
database including key management lifecycle and integration into existing
ecosystem.

I have built cluster controller that allowed to implement on-premise deployed
data clusters with custom encryption plugins and data coordination.

I have contributed to in-house database to ensure its support of horizontal
scalability.

I participated in incidents technical analysis. Especially database failures.

### Software Engineer in Infrastructure R&D Team at Workato

_June 2021 - September 2023 (Rust, Go, C/C++, Ruby)_

Workato makes one of the best no-code automation platforms.

I have been developing optimizations, systems, and research projects for
our infrastructure platform to drive performance and security enhancements
across the stack. (Linux Kernel, Linux Containers, C/C++, Rust, Go, and Ruby)

Achievements:

- Developed in-house distributed serverless compute platform like in-house AWS
  Lambda or Google Function or something similar to what Fly.io is doing.
- Optimized sandboxes bootstrap. I saved more than x2 in wall clock time,
  -30% of total production CPU usage, and 100GBs of total cluster RAM usage.
- Developed rootless containers teleportation technology for Ruby VM based on LXC.
- Wrote a couple of native (C/C++) addons to different VMs (Ruby and Node.js).
- Developed in-house Linux containerization system.
- Developed Kubernetes network traffic monitoring system.

Responsibilities:

- Containerization (lxc, containerd/libcontainer, gvisor, wasm internals) and
  isolation, Kubernetes (internals), Linux (debugging) development and
  derivatives
- Performance optimizations (research, patching)
- Observability (research, development)
- Ruby VM internals (research, patching)
- Debugging various production issues, including OOMs, deadlocks, stalls, and
  Linux kernel-related problems.

### Senior Software Engineer at ScyllaDB Inc.

_Oct 2019 - May 2021_

ScyllaDB is a high-performance NoSQL database written in C++.

Projects: DBaaS (Golang, AWS) and Field Engineering (C++, Go, Python, Bash, Java).

- DBaaS Development: I was building Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) as part of
  the cloud team with Go.
- Field Engineering: Leveraged expertise in C++, Java, Go, and Python to conduct
  production-level customer-faced investigations and contribute to ScyllaDB,
  including the creation of patches (tracing optimizations) and tools (ansible
  plugins) for enhancing functionality and performance.
- Benchmarks and Open-Source Contributions: Actively participated in OSS
  benchmarking activities, evaluating the performance and efficiency of
  ScyllaDB. Made contributions (ie YCSB) to open-source projects, sharing
  knowledge and insights with the software development community.

### Principal Software Engineer at Nimses

- Developed a fault-tolerant cluster monitoring system across multiple data
  centers, on top of our Consul infrastructure. Implemented a monitoring system
  to provide comprehensive overviews of cluster states, integrating with
  Stackify, PagerDuty, VictorOps, and other 24x7 services. Inspired by
  Facebook's OSQuery, InfluxDB, Vector Clocks, CRDTs, and ZooKeeper LE.
- Created a distributed execution framework in PowerShell (WinRT) capable of
  simultaneously updating hundreds of Windows servers. Automated deployment
  procedures for streamlined and efficient processes.
- Built a Go client for Microsoft Azure Storage services.
- Built distributed passive synchronization of user plugins
- Engaged in extensive research and usage of Consul, Vault, Nomad, and
  InfluxDB.

### Team Lead, Software Engineer at Neodinamika
