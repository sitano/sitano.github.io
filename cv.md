## SUMMARY

Software Engineer (SWE).

I build systems that run on Linux in the cloud with Open Source. Distributed
Systems, System Programming, and Databases. Go, Rust, C/C++, Java, and whatever
it takes.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Senior Software Engineer at Workato

June 2021 - Present
Senior Software Engineer (C/C++, Go, Rust, Ruby, Python)

R&D: I have been developing optimizations, systems, and research projects for
our infrastructure platform to drive performance and security enhancements
across the stack. Linux Kernel, Linux Containers, C/C++, Rust, Go, and Ruby.

Achievements:

- Developed in-house distributed serverless compute platform think AWS Lambda
  or Google Function or something similar to what Fly.io is doing.
- Optimized sandboxes spawn speed. I saved more than x2 in wall clock time,
  -30% of total production CPU usage, and -100GBs of total cluster RAM usage.
- Developed rootless containers teleportation technology for the old Ruby VM.
- Wrote a couple of native (C/C++) add-ons to different VMs (Ruby and Node.js).
- Developed in-house Linux containerization.
- Developed Kubernetes network traffic monitoring system.

Responsibilities:

- Containerization (lxc, containerd/libcontainer, gvisor, wasm internals) and
  isolation, Kubernetes (internals), Linux (debugging) development and
  derivatives
- Performance optimizations (research, patching)
- Observability (research, development)
- Ruby VM internals (research, patching)
- Debugging various production issues, including OOMs, deadlocks, stalls, and
  Linux kernel-related problems.

Skills: Linux · Distributed Systems · Rust (Programming Language) · C

### Software Engineer at ScyllaDB Inc.

Oct 2019 - May 2021
Field Engineering (C++, Go, Python, Bash, Java) and DBaaS (Cloud/Go).

- Field Engineering: Leveraged expertise in C++, Go, and Python to conduct
  production-level customer-faced investigations and contribute to ScyllaDB,
  including the creation of patches (tracing optimizations) and tools (ansible
  plugins) for enhancing functionality and performance.
- DBaaS Development: Was part of the Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) team using
  Go, providing scalable and efficient database management capabilities.
- Benchmarks and Open-Source Contributions: Actively participated in OSS
  benchmarking activities, evaluating the performance and efficiency of
  ScyllaDB. Made contributions (ie YCSB) to open-source projects, sharing
  knowledge and insights with the software development community.
- DevRel-ed a bit: Authored a few articles on databases and ScyllaDB
  performance.

Bonus:
- We won in-house hackathon with our team by developing S3 binary-compatible
  frontend for ScyllaDB
