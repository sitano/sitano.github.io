title: What to measure about performance
---

People usually think about performance wrong, resulting in asking wrong
questions like can your server handle 10K connections or 2000000 users?.

...

What is important to remember: Performance is a multidimensional characteristics.
its impossible to make a picture of the system performance using only 1 metric.

When you asked about how good some stream of something is performing,
you should think about:

- Throughput, Bandwidth
- Latency
- Response time
- Footprint

The relation between throughput and latency is described by
[Little's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law).
