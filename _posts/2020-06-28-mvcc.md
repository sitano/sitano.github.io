Multi-version histories
---

In conventional histories at any point in time there exists only one version of a variable.
That means that the _write_ operations always rewrite previous version and the _read_ operations
always read the latest written version as it is defined by the schedule semantics:

$$ w_1(x) w_2(x) r_3(x), H_s(r_3(x))\ =\ H_s(w_2(x)) $$

where $$ H_s $$ is a function that assigns every read the latest write to the corresponding variable.

Imagine that you can travel back in time. How it could look like?

$$ w_1(x) r_3(x) w_2(x), H_s(r_3(x))\ =\ H_s(w_1(x)) $$

Here we send read $$ r_3(x) $$ back in time to read the output of the transaction $$ t_1 $$.

How it could look like without commuting operations in the history? The answer is simple:
with the references to the previous versions of variables.

$$ w_1(x_1) w_2(x_2) r_3(x_1), h(r_3(x)) = w_1(x) $$

Here we have a writes that create versions $$ \{ x_1, x_2 \} $$
of a variable $$ x $$. And the read that reads one version of $$ t_1 $$.
Function $$ h $$ is called a version function. With the version function
the multi-version histories comes into play.

Such histories like one above are called multi-version (mv) histories. It is histories
with defined version function that says who reads what. A read operation can read one of
the previously written versions of a variable. If the version function always returns
the latest version for reads the history called monoversion. Conventional histories
are equivalent to corresponding monoversion variants.

With mv histories we can produce more serializable schedules. Weikum & Vossen gives
a great example of how much bigger the power of scheduling can be with the mv-histories.
Consider the following history:

$$ s = r_1(x) w_1(x) r_2(x) w_2(y) r_1(y) w_1(z) c_1 c_2 $$

![]({{ Site.url }}/public/mvcc/chsgcg.png)

This history is not conflict-serializable due to the fact that $$ r_1(y) $$ arrived
too late so it creates a cycle in the conflict graph of $$ s $$. This history could
be serializable in example if $$ r_1(y) $$ came before $$ w_2(y) $$:

$$ s_2 = r_1(x) w_1(x) r_2(x) r_1(y) w_2(y) w_1(z) c_1 c_2 $$

$$ s_2 $$ does not have a cycle in the conflict graph so it is conflict-serializable.
That's cool. But we don't control the order in which events arrive in our scheduler.
What we control, is the point in time from which the read operation reads a version.
We can define a version function so that serializability of $$ s $$ will become
possible:

$$ h(r_1(y)) = w_0(y) $$

That means that $$ r_1(y) $$ will read the version of $$ y $$ written by the initial
transaction $$ t_0 $$ literally the previous version before $$ t_2 $$:

$$ m = r_1(x_0) w_1(x_1) r_2(x_1) w_2(y_2) r_1(y_0) w_1(z_1) c_1 c_2 $$

This multi-version history $$ m $$ is conflict equivalent to the:  

$$ m_2 = r_1(x_0) w_1(x_1) r_2(x_1) [ r_1(y_0) w_2(y_2) ] w_1(z_1) c_1 c_2 $$

in which we only commuted 2 operations. $$ m_2 $$ is a monoversion history that is
equivalent to $$ s_2 $$ and $$ s_2 \in CSR $$:

$$ s_2 = r_1(x) w_1(x) r_2(x) r_1(y) w_2(y) w_1(z) c_1 c_2 $$

Now when it's obvious that MVCC is capable of producing more of a correct
serializable schedulers let's take a look at how the serializability works
in a case of multi-version histories.

Multi-version serializability
---

There are 2 kinds of MV serializability:

- MVSR - multi-version view serializability
- MCSR - multi-version conflict serializability

MVSR is defined by the analogy with the VSR:
$$ m \in MVSR $$ if and only if there exists a serial monoversion
schedule $$ m' $$ for the same set of transactions such that
$$ RF(m) = RF(m') $$ where $$ RF $$ is a _read-from_ relation.

The final state view in MVSR is not relevant any more because any
permutation of operations in $$ s $$ will produce the same final
state view because writes do not erase previous versions.

MCSR by the analogy with CSR is a class in which for a history $$ m $$
there $$ \exists\ m' - {serial\ monoversion} $$ for the same set of transactions
such that all conflict pairs of $$ m $$ occur in the same order in $$ m' $$.

Interesting nuance of the MV conflict set is its asymmetry:
conflict set consists of the $$ (r_j(x_i), w_k(x_k)) $$ pairs
such that $$ w_i(x_i) <_m r_j(x_i) <_m w_k(x_k) $$. So there are
no _ww_ and _wr_ pairs in the mv-conflict set because commuting _ww_
does not change anything for the following read operations,
and commuting _wr_ pairs does not affect the read variants
space in a negative way so if the history with _rw_ pair
is serializable the one with the _wr_ pair is serializable
as well.

This asymmetry leads to the asymmetry in serializability class
definition such that it's $$ m $$ conflict pairs must occur in
the same order in $$ m' $$, not the pairs from $$ m' $$. More
details in [[3]]. I have spent some time reading out the
definition of the MCSR in Vossen & Weikum book because they
do not make an accent on that nuance from my point of view.

The relation between classes is as follows:

$$ CSR \subset MCSR \subset MVSR \subset {histories} \\ $$
$$ CSR \subset VSR \subset MVSR\\ $$

On testing serializability
---

Let's take a look at how a history may be tested for the multi-version
serializability. We will start with testing for MCSR and then
continue with the MVSR with this example:

$$ m = w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 w_1(x_1) c_1 r_2(x_1) w_2(y_2) c_2 r_3(y_0) w_3(x_3) c_3 $$

Let's draw a multi-version conflict graph (MVCG):

![]({{ Site.url }}/public/mvcc/mv_conflict_graph.png)

MVCG has no cycles and thus is acyclic. Hence $$ m \in MCSR $$. For even
greater simplicity let's take a look at the $$ m $$ step-graph along with
the MV conflict set. It will show us in a graphical way where the single
conflict edge $$ x $$ originates from and what we can commute to get
serial monoversion history $$ m' $$ that will be $$ m \approx_c m' $$.

![]({{ Site.url }}/public/mvcc/mv_step_graph_wcs.png)

Now let's commute something in $$ m $$ to find $$ m' $$ - serial monoversion history.
What can confuse here is that the history $$ m $$ is already serial but not monoversion.
Intuitively, what you would try to do first is to have $$ m' = t_0 t_3 t_1 t_2 $$
but it is incorrect, because reverses conflict pair $$ (r_2(x_1), w_3(x_3)) $$
which we can't commute. So the only chance we have is to move $$ t_0 $$ forward,
commuting operations 1-by-1:

$$
m = w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 w_1(x_1) c_1 r_2(x_1) w_2(y_2) c_2 r_3(y_0) w_3(x_3) c_3 \\
[ w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 ] [ w_1(x_1) c_1 r_2(x_1) w_2(y_2) c_2 ] r_3(y_0) w_3(x_3) c_3 \\
[ w_1(x_1) c_1 r_2(x_1) w_2(y_2) c_2 ] [ w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 ] r_3(y_0) w_3(x_3) c_3 \\
m' = w_1(x_1) c_1 r_2(x_1) w_2(y_2) c_2 w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 r_3(y_0) w_3(x_3) c_3 \\
m' = t_1 t_2 t_0 t_3 \\
\approx \\
s' = w_1(x) c_1 r_2(x) w_2(y) c_2 w_0(x) w_0(y) c_0 r_3(y) w_3(x) c_3 \\
= t_1 t_2 t_0 t_3
$$

The fun part is that we moved our transactions $$ t_1, t_2 $$ back in time behind
the $$ t_0 $$ that is an initial state transaction. However, commuting $$ t_0 $$
did not prevent us from imagining the proper serial monoversion history even tho
the whole thing is equivalent to the history in which we send scheduling transactions
even further back in time.

The conflicts of $$ m $$ occur in the same order in $$ m' $$ so we are good:

![]({{ Site.url }}/public/mvcc/mvsm_step_graph_wcs.png)

We have proved that $$ m \in MCSR $$ and found serial monoversion $$ m' $$
such that $$ m \approx_c m' $$.
Now let's take a look at how $$ m $$ looks like in MVSR. We already know
that $$ MCSR \subset MVSR $$ so $$ m \in MCSR \Rightarrow m \in MVSR $$.

But in anyway, is it $$ m' $$ that we found for the MCSR case is sufficient
for the MVSR. Let's test it!

First of all, let's prove that $$ m \in MVSR $$ on it's own.
We will build a multi-version serializability graph (MVSG) to see it is
acycle. We can't do that without defining a version order relation up front.
In anyway, MVSR is defined as $$ RF(m) = RF(m') $$, so let's start with the
step-graph with read-from relation:

![]({{ Site.url }}/public/mvcc/mv_step_graph_wrf.png)

What you see here is 1/3 of the MVSG edges that consists of the conflict
graph $$ G(s) $$ that are _wr_ edges of the form $$ (w_i(x_i), r_j(x_i)) $$.
The rest consists of the conflicts depending on the versions order.

Now taking the version ordering from our $$ m' $$ MCSR case we are having:

$$
x_1 << x_0 << x_3 \\
y_2 << y_0
$$

For $$ r_2(x_1) $$ we have $$ w_1(x_1) <_{m'} r_2(x_1) <_{m'} w_0(x_0) $$ and
$$ w_1(x_1) <_{m'} r_2(x_1) <_{m'} w_3(x_3) $$ so we must add 2 edges to the MVSG:
$$ \{(r_2(x_1), w_0(x_0)), (r_2(x_1), w_3(x_3))\} $$.

For $$ r_3(y_0) $$ we have $$ w_2(y_2) <_{m'} w_0(y_0) <_{m'} r_3(y_0) $$
so we must add an edge to the MVSG: $$ (w_2(y_2), w_0(y_0)) $$.

So we have got:

![]({{ Site.url }}/public/mvcc/mv_step_graph_wcs2.png)

By collapsing operations into the transactions vertices we can obtain a MVSG:

![]({{ Site.url }}/public/mvcc/mvsg.png)

It's easy to see it is acycle and that means $$ m \in MVSR $$ and the version
order we picked based on $$ m' $$ serial monoversion history is good enough.

For more curiosity we can compare _read-from_ sets of $$ m, m' $$:

$$
m = w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 w_1(x_1) c_1 r_2(x_1) w_2(y_2) c_2 r_3(y_0) w_3(x_3) c_3 \\
RF(m) = \{ (t_1, x, t_2), (t_0, y, t_3) \} \\
m' = w_1(x_1) c_1 r_2(x_1) w_2(y_2) c_2 w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 r_3(y_0) w_3(x_3) c_3 \\
= t_1 t_2 t_0 t_3 \\
RF(m') = \{ (t_1, x, t_2), (t_0, y, t_3) \} \\
\Rightarrow \\
RF(m) = RF(m') \\
\Rightarrow \\
m \in MVSR
$$

And finally for those who are curious how the version function looks like
for $$ m $$:

$$
h(r_2(x)) = w_2(x) \\
h(r_3(y)) = w_0(y) \\
h(w_i(a)) = w_i(a)
$$

MVCC schedulers
---

We have seen what is MV serializability, how it is defined and works.
Now it is time to take a look at algorithms that can produce mv-serializable
schedulers. Let's start with the following history sample:

$$ s = r_1(x) r_2(x) r_3(y) w_2(x) w_1(y) c_1 w_2(z) w_3(z) r_3(x) c_3 r_2(y) c_2 $$

First of all we will find out if $$ s $$ is multi-version serializable and
then take a look at the schedulers output. If $$ s $$ is mv-serializable
it must have a version function that matches serializability criteria. But
even before that, we can test it for mv-conflict/serializability graph acyclicity.

Here is our step-graph:

![]({{ Site.url }}/public/mvcc/mv_step_graph2.png)

It is easy to imagine what possible mv-serializable schedule would likely have in
conflicts and versions. The version function will map writes to unique variables
versions anyway: $$ h(w_i(a)) = w_i(a_i) $$. Also, it will map reads to the latest
versions at least if there are only single one of them: $$ h(r_1(x)) = w_0(x_0) $$,
$$ h(r_2(x)) = w_0(x_0) $$, $$ h(r_3(y)) = w_0(y_0) $$.

![]({{ Site.url }}/public/mvcc/mv_step_graph3.png)

We have drawn all possible mv-conflicts and even tho we did not define versions for
$$ \{ r_3(x), r_2(y) \} $$ what ever they will be, they will not contribute to the
mv-conflict set. Thus, we can now choose what ever we like and let's pick last
committed versions.

$$ m = w_0(x) w_0(y) c_0 r_1(x_0) r_2(x_0) r_3(y_0) w_2(x_2) w_1(y_1) c_1 w_2(z_2) w_3(z_3) r_3(x_1) c_3 r_2(y_1) c_2 $$

$$ m $$ mv-conflict graph is acycle and hence $$ m \in MCSR \Rightarrow m \in MVSR $$.

It's easy to pick proper $$ m' $$ for $$ m \in MCSR $$ based on restrictions implied
by the conflict edges:

$$
t_1 < t_2, t_3 < t1 \\
\Rightarrow \\
t_3 < t_1 < t_2 \\
\Rightarrow \\
m' = t_0 t_3 t_1 t_2 \\
= w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 [r_3(y_0) w_3(z_3) r_3(x_1) c_3] [r_1(x_0) w_1(y_1) c_1] r_2(x_0) w_2(x_2) w_2(z_2) r_2(y_1) c_2 \\
\approx \\
= w_0(x) w_0(y) c_0 [r_3(y) w_3(z) r_3(x) c_3] [r_1(x) w_1(y) c_1] r_2(x) w_2(x) w_2(z) r_2(y) c_2 \\
m' - {serial\ monoversion}\ | \\
r_1(x_0) <_m w_2(x_2) \land r_1(x_0) <_{m'} w_2(x_2) \\
r_2(y_0) <_m w_1(y_1) \land r_2(y_0) <_{m'} w_1(y_1) \\
\Rightarrow \\
MVCG(m) \subset MVCG(m') \\
\Rightarrow \\
m \in MCSR
$$

MVTO
---

Now, when we are sure that $$ m $$ is mv-serializable and what one possible variant of
the version function looks like, let's take a look what we will get with the scheduling
algorithms. We will start with the pessimistic non-locking MV Timestamp Ordering (MVTO)
scheduler.

MVTO tracks a timestamp for every transaction that corresponds to it's first operation.

For $$ s $$ we will have:

$$
s = r_1(x) r_2(x) r_3(y) w_2(x) w_1(y) c_1 w_2(z) w_3(z) r_3(x) c_3 r_2(y) c_2 \\
r_1(x) <_s r_2(x) <_s r_3(y) \\
ts(t_1) < ts(t_2) < ts(t_3)
$$

Now we can produce an mv-schedule by outputting operations according to these rules:

1. $$ r_i(x) \to\ r_i(x_k)\ |\ w_k(x_k) < r_i(x) \land ts(t_k) < ts(t_i) \land i \neq k $$
2. $$ w_i(x) \to\ w_i(x_i)\ if\ \nexists\ step\ r_j(x_k)\ |\ ts(t_k) < ts(t_i) < ts(t_j), a_i\ otherwise $$
3. $$ c_i $$ is delayed until all transactions that have written new versions of data
   items read by $$ t_i $$ have been processed.

Based on these rules we are getting:

| Input          | Output         | Rule                |
| -----          | ------         | ----                |
| $$ w_0(x) $$   | $$ w_0(x_0) $$ | initial value       |
| $$ w_0(y) $$   | $$ w_0(y_0) $$ | initial value       |
| $$ c_0    $$   | $$ c_0      $$ | initial transaction |
| $$ r_1(x) $$   | $$ r_1(x_0) $$ | rule 1              |
| $$ r_2(x) $$   | $$ r_2(x_0) $$ | rule 1              |
| $$ r_3(y) $$   | $$ r_3(y_0) $$ | rule 1              |
| $$ w_2(x) $$   | $$ w_2(x_2) $$ | rule 2: $$ \exists\ r_1(x_0)\ \| ts(t_0) < ts(t_1) < ts(t_2) $$ |
| $$ w_1(y) $$   | $$ a_1      $$ | rule 2: $$ \exists\ r_3(y_0)\ \| ts(t_0) < ts(t_1) < ts(t_3) $$ |
| $$ w_2(z) $$   | $$ w_2(z_2) $$ | rule 2: no one read z |
| $$ w_3(z) $$   | $$ w_3(z_3) $$ | rule 2: no one read z |
| $$ r_3(x) $$   | $$ r_3(x_2) $$ | rule 1                |
| $$ c_3    $$   | wait $$ t_2 $$ | rule 3: $$ c_3 $$ delayed until $$ t_2 $$ because $$ r_3(x_2) $$ was issued and $$ t_2 $$ did not commit yet: $$ t3 \to t2 $$ |
| $$ r_2(y) $$   | $$ r_2(y_0) $$ | rule 1                |
| $$ c_2    $$   | $$ c_2      $$ | rule 2: $$ t_2 $$ did not read any uncommitted values |
| queued $$ c_3$$| $$ c_3      $$ | rule 3: $$ t_2 $$ has been committed, so we can commit $$ t_3 $$ |

Result is:

$$
m = w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 r_1(x_0) r_2(x_0) r_3(y_0) w_2(x_2) a_1 w_2(z_2) w_3(z_3) r_3(x_2) r_2(y_0) c_2 c_3 \\
\approx \\
m = w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0          r_2(x_0) r_3(y_0) w_2(x_2)     w_2(z_2) w_3(z_3) r_3(x_2) r_2(y_0) c_2 c_3
$$

MVTO guarantees at least MVSR but we were lucky enough to get $$ m \in MCSR $$ with 1 transaction aborted:

$$
m = w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0          r_2(x_0) r_3(y_0) w_2(x_2)     w_2(z_2) w_3(z_3) r_3(x_2) r_2(y_0) c_2 c_3 \\
\approx_c \\
m' = t_0 t_2 t_3 \\
$$

MV2PL
---

MV2PL family of scheduling algorithms is based on conforming the 2PL rule:
A transaction is said to satisfy the two-phase locking (2PL)
protocol if all of its locking operations precede all of its unlock operations.

Most of them have different handling of the internal and the final steps
of the transactions. Usually they are relaxed on the write conflicts but
the written versions must be certified.

In MV2PL transactions can write as many versions as they want but can
read only the latest current version. Depending on the protocol variant
the current version may allow reading only the latest certified committed
versions or also an uncommitted version. The scheduler makes sure that
at each point in time there is at most one uncommitted version of any
data item.

MV2PL as well as 2V2PL uses 3 types of locks: read, write and certify.
MV2PL uses the following locks compatibility [matrix][4]:

|            | Holder | $$ r(x) $$ | $$ w(x) $$ | $$ c(x) $$ |
| -------    | ------ | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Request    |        |            |            |            |
| $$ r(x) $$ |        |     +      |     +      |     -      |
| $$ w(x) $$ |        |     +      |     +      |     +      |
| $$ c(x) $$ |        |     -      |     +      |     -      |

That result into the following rules:

1. If the step is not final within a transaction:
   - (a) $$ r_i(x) \to r_i(x_j) $$ where $$ x_j $$ is the current version
of the requested data item;
   - (b) $$ w_i(x) \to w_i(x_i) $$ if there are no uncommitted versions of x, or waits otherwise
2. If the step is final within transaction $$ t_i $$ it is delayed until the following
   types of transactions are committed:
   - (a) all those $$ t_j $$ that have read the data item written by $$ t_i $$
   - (b) all those $$ t_j $$ from which $$ t_i $$ has read

Applying these rules we are getting:

| Input          | Output                         | Rule                                                   |

|                | deadlock $$ \{ t_1, t_2 \} $$  | we have a wait cycle: $$ t_1 \to t_2 \to t_1 $$

Even though we know that $$ s $$ is mv-serializable MV2PL failed to
produce nice schedule for us. What we have got is only the 1 committed
transaction $$ t_3 $$ and 2 deadlocked transactions.

2V2PL is a MV2PL variant in which number of versions per item is limited by 2:
pre-image and after-image. This is a nice property because it allows to reduce
storage utilization that is desirable for real world implementations.

The algorithm also uses 3 locks but with different compatibility matrix [[1]] [[4]]:

|            | Holder | $$ r(x) $$ | $$ w(x) $$ | $$ c(x) $$ |
| -------    | ------ | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Request    |        |            |            |            |
| $$ r(x) $$ |        |     +      |     +      |     -      |
| $$ w(x) $$ |        |     +      |     -      |     -      |
| $$ c(x) $$ |        |     -      |     -      |     -      |

Derived rules are the same as in MV2PL. Scheduling for $$ s $$ will be the following:

| Input          | Output                         | Rule                                                   |
| -----          | ------                         | ----                                                   |
| $$ w_0(x) $$   | $$ wl_0(x) w_0(x_0) $$         | initial value                                          |
| $$ w_0(y) $$   | $$ wl_0(y) w_0(y_0) $$         | initial value                                          |
| $$ c_0    $$   | $$ cl_0(x) cl_0(y) ul_0 c_0 $$ | certify locks, full unlock, commit initial transaction |
| $$ r_1(x) $$   | $$ rl_1(x) r_1(x_0) $$         | rule (1.a) |
| $$ r_2(x) $$   | $$ rl_2(x) r_2(x_0) $$         | rule (1.a) |
| $$ r_3(y) $$   | $$ rl_3(x) r_3(y_0) $$         | rule (1.a) |
| $$ w_2(x) $$   | $$ wl_2(x) w_2(x_2) $$         | rule (1.b) |
| $$ w_1(y) $$   | $$ wl_1(y) w_1(y_1) $$         | rule (1.b) |
| $$ c_1    $$   | wait $$ t_3: rl_3(y)$$         | rule (2.a): $$ t_1 $$ must certify write $$ w_1(y_1) $$ before commit but $$ y_0 $$ was read by unfinished $$ t_3 $$, so that $$ t_3 $$ holds an incompatible read lock to the certify lock we want issue for $$ t_1 $$ |
| $$ w_2(z) $$   | $$ wl_2(z) w_2(z_2) $$         | rule (1.b) |
| $$ w_3(z) $$   | wait $$ t_2: wl_2(z)$$       | rule (1.b): $$ t_3 $$ must acquire write lock on $$ z $$, but there is incompatible lock held by $$ t_2 $$
| $$ r_3(x) $$   | queued                         | blocked: $$ t_3 \to t_2 $$ |
| $$ c_3    $$   | queued                         | blocked |
| $$ r_2(y) $$   | $$ rl_2(y) r_2(y_0) $$         | rule (1.a) |
| $$ c_2    $$   | wait $$ t_1: r_1(x) $$         | rule (2.a): $$ t_2 $$ must certify write $$ w_2(x_2) $$ before commit but $$ x_0 $$ was read by unfinished $$ t_1 $$, so that $$ t_1 $$ holds an incompatible read lock to the certify lock we want issue for $$ t_2 $$ |
|                | all transactions deadlock      | we have a wait cycle: $$ t_1 \to t_3 \to t_2 \to t_1 $$

Even though we know that $$ s $$ is mv-serializable 2V2PL failed as well to
produce fine schedule. All transactions deadlock in loop involving all of them.

ROMV
---

ROMV goes even further than 2V2PL and offers a classical S2PL algorithm for
update-transactions but optimizes read-only transactions with a non-blocking
variant. It allows non-interfering long-running read-only transactions to be
processed effectively - literally by reading versions committed before the start.
It is especially useful for the web applications that usually do more reads than
the writes.

It may be not applicable to all use cases because requires to classify
transactions in advance into _rw_, _ro_ categories.

The rules for the ROMV are as follows:

1. For _update_ transactions: obey S/S2PL. It's a classic 2PL plus transactions
   must hold their write locks until the final step - commit. Versions timestamped
   by the time of the transaction commit.

2. For _read-only_ transactions: Transactions acquire are timestamped by their
   beginning unlike the _update_ transactions. Read operations read the most
   recently committed versions right before their transaction timestamp.

S/S2PL is having the following compatibility matrix:

|            | Holder | $$ r(x) $$ | $$ w(x) $$ |
| -------    | ------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Request    |        |            |            |
| $$ r(x) $$ |        |     +      |     -      |
| $$ w(x) $$ |        |     -      |     -      |

So we are getting:

| Input          | Output                         | Rule                               |
| -----          | ------                         | ----                               |
| $$ w_0(x) $$   | $$ wl_0(x) w_0(x_0)  $$        | initial value                      |
| $$ w_0(y) $$   | $$ wl_0(y) w_0(y_0)  $$        | initial value                      |
| $$ c_0    $$   | $$ ul_0 c_0          $$        | unlock, commit initial transaction |
| $$ r_1(x) $$   | $$ rl_1(x) r_1(x_0)  $$        | |
| $$ r_2(x) $$   | $$ rl_2(x) r_2(x_0)  $$        | |
| $$ r_3(y) $$   | $$ rl_3(y) r_3(y_0)  $$        | |
| $$ w_2(x) $$   | wait $$ t_1: rl_1(x) $$        | $$ wl_2(x) $$ conflicts with $$ rl_1(x) $$ so $$ t_2 $$ blocks for $$ t_1 $$ |
| $$ w_1(y) $$   | wait $$ t_3: rl_3(y) $$        | $$ wl_1(x) $$ conflicts with $$ rl_3(y) $$ so $$ t_1 $$ blocks for $$ t_3 $$ |
| $$ c_1    $$   | queued                         | blocked by $$ t_3 $$ |
| $$ w_2(z) $$   | queued                         | blocked by $$ t_1 $$ |
| $$ w_3(z) $$   | $$ wl_3(z) w_3(z_3)  $$        | |
| $$ r_3(x) $$   | $$ rl_3(x) r_3(x_0)  $$        | |
| $$ c_3    $$   | $$ ul_3 c_3 $$                 | now $$ t_1 $$ may proceed |
| $$ w_1(y) $$ q | $$ wl_1(y) w_1(y_1)  $$        | |
| $$ c_1    $$ q | $$ ul_1 c_1 $$                 | now $$ t_2 $$ may proceed |
| $$ w_2(x) $$ q | $$ wl_2(x) w_2(x_2)  $$        | |
| $$ w_2(z) $$ q | $$ wl_2(z) w_2(z_2)  $$        | |
| $$ r_2(y) $$   | $$ rl_2(y) r_2(y_0)  $$        | |
| $$ c_2    $$   | $$ ul_2 c_2 $$                 | |

Result is:

$$
m = w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 r_1(x_0) r_2(x_0) r_3(y_0) w_3(z_3) r_3(x_0) c_3 w_1(y_1) c_1 w_2(x_2) w_2(z_2) r_2(y_0) c_2
$$

ROMV guarantees at least MVSR but we were lucky enough to get $$ m \in MCSR $$ and all transactions committed:

$$
m = w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 [ r_1(x_0) r_2(x_0) ] r_3(y_0) w_3(z_3) r_3(x_0) c_3 w_1(y_1) c_1 w_2(x_2) w_2(z_2) r_2(y_0) c_2 \\
commute \\
= w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 r_3(y_0) w_3(z_3) r_3(x_0) c_3 [ r_1(x_0) r_2(x_0) ] w_1(y_1) c_1 w_2(x_2) w_2(z_2) r_2(y_0) c_2 \\
commute \\
= w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 r_3(y_0) w_3(z_3) r_3(x_0) c_3 r_1(x_0) w_1(y_1) c_1 [ r_2(x_0) ] w_2(x_2) w_2(z_2) r_2(y_0) c_2 \\
\Rightarrow
m \approx_c m' = t_0 t_3 t_1 t_2
$$

MVSGT
---

I will left it for the home work.

MVSGT is similar to SGT and tracks MV conflict graph in real time to
ensure serializability. MVSGT produces MCSR schedules.

Anomalies in SI
---

Snapshot isolation (SI) uses items versions to provide consistent view (reads) of
a database state (snapshot) in some point in time. Thus it requires MVCC. The thing is
the resulting histories are not necessarily serializable. As far as MVCC is a way to
implement Snapshot Isolation (SI), let's take a look at what anomalies
does SI exposes.

For the details about what exactly SI is let's turn to the work [[6]]:

1. A transaction $$ t_i $$ executing under SI conceptually reads data
   from the committed state of the database as of time $$ start(t_i) $$ (the
   snapshot). So it exploit reads as in ROMV for read-only transactions.

2. Snapshot Isolation must obey a "First Committer Wins" rule:
   the transaction may be committed only if there are no other
   transactions $$ t_j $$ that wrote data items that $$ t_i $$
   wrote. It must be aborted otherwise.

Before [[6]] it was widely assumed that, under SI, read-only transactions
always execute serializably provided the concurrent update transactions
are serializable. They refuted it by showing presence of the Read Skew under SI.
Possibility of the Write Skew was known before.

At this point, I would like to quote a definition of the SI by work [[5]]:

A system provides Snapshot Isolation if it prevents phenomena G0, G1a, G1b,
G1c, PMP, OTV, and Lost Updates.

What we are left with are: G-single (read skew), G2-item (write skew),
G2 (write skew on predicates).

So how actually read and write skew looks like?

Write skew
---

$$ m = w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 r_1(x_0) r_2(x_0) r_1(y_0) r_2(y_0) w_1(x_1) c_1 w_2(y_2) c_2 $$

that can break $$ f(x, y) $$ invariant.

Read skew
---

In read skew one of the transactions is read-only and it turns out the serializable
schedule into non-serializable:

$$ m = w_0(x_0) w_0(y_0) c_0 r_2(x_0) r_2(y_0) r_1(y_0) w_1(y_1) c_1 r_3(x_0) r_3(y_1) c_3 w_2(x_2) c_2 $$

SSI
---

In 2012 it was shown how SI may be implemented to produce only serializable
schedules. It's called SSI [[7]].
